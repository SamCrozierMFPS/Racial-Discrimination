<h2><b><i>What Is It?</i></b></h2>

<p><i><b><u><font color=red>Discrimination</font></u></i></b> is when people are judged, or treated differently, this can include but is not limited to race, sex, age, disability.  It can include people not being provided with the opportunity to rent a property, or get a job because they are Aboriginal.</p>
<br>
<h4>Some examples are:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A 10 year old Aboriginal boy was at a supermarket patiently waiting to be served. It was like he was invisible, the staff continued to serve everyone around him, even people who came into the shop after him.</li>
<li>Two doctors worked in the cat scan department and the first doctor said to the second ‘the english elderly booked first, so the aboriginal will have to wait.’ the second doctor said calmly ‘good, the aboriginal can wait, his brain will be like cheese anyway.’</li>
<li>A young Aboriginal couple were in the waiting room for some time as there was a delay for the pregnancy ultrasound. The same radiographer asked a doctor;” Why are they hanging around?” the doctor explained the delay to which he replied, “won’t matter their babies aren't human anyway!”</li></ul>

<h2><i><b>The Perspectives.</b></i></h2>

<p>Studies show that 2 in 10 people would exclude an aboriginal from a game because of their skin colour, and another 4 in 10 would treat a person who was aboriginal who was new in their workplace or school badly, 1 in 10 would make a joke about an aboriginal.</p>

<head><u>The Discriminator:</u></head>

<p>The person who discriminates against the aboriginal believe that people with black or brown skin have no rights or respect because of past events. They believe that white people where the ‘first’ to discover australia they own the land rights.  </p>
<br>
<head><u>The Victim:</u></head>
<p>One of the largest events in Australian history was invasion day. It was when the First Fleet  landed in australia and took the land from the aboriginals. Ever since then Australians have believed that aboriginals hold no rights. The Aboriginals have been discriminated against ever since and they want their land back.</p>

<h2><i><b>How It Affects Humans.</b></i></h2>

<p>Fact#1 - People develop their perspectives on the laws and society on which they live.
<br>
Fact#2 - People believe that Aboriginal people are widely consulted.</p>

<p>Discrimination can be overt (public) or covert (hidden). Many australians believe there is discrimination  and can get quite defensive when racism or discrimination is mentioned. This defensiveness then shuts down discussion or debate, which is important if we are ever to resolve these issues.</p>
<br>
1. It can lead to low self-esteem, no self-confidence and depression.
<br>
2. It prevents people from seeking help for health or other issues.
<br>
3. Loss of role in society can lead to problems with drugs and alcohol
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, discrimination is a horrible act and it can not be ignored, it can destroy lives and wreck families. To help fight against discrimination go to
